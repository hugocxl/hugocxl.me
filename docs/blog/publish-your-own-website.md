Hi there👋,

the moment finally arrived and, after spending the last week working on it, today I’ll be publishing this website.

Although I could spend some more time improving or adding stuff, I’ve realised that I’ll never reach the point where I’ll be completely done with it (as it happens with any other project: there is always something I wanna change or this other feature it’d cool to have, etc.) and I think that the current status is pretty good actually, so I’ll go with it.

## Why having your own website is important?

In case you’re doubting about having your personal space online, these are some of the most important reasons for me to do so:

1. **Improve online presence:** in these times we are living not being present online is close to non-existing at all, and while this is not mandatory, I would recommend you to taking it into account considering its benefit/cost radio: owning a domain is not expensive anymore (I’ve paid 45,62€ for 5 years owning [hugocorta.com](https://hugocorta.com/)) and there are thousands of no-code options out there that may help you to publish. Think how difficult for a person looking for you is to find out about you on the Internet otherwise.
2. **Express yourself:** having your own controlled space where you can truly express yourself is very important. Within there you’re not restricted by any condition or policy rules as in other platforms. You fully control your content as well as how it’s presented. Therefore it’s the most personal way to really introduce yourself online.
3. **Show your work:** one of the most interesting aspects of owning a personal website is that you have a space where you can show what you do and openly talk about it. Think of it as your personal portfolio where you can show other people what you do.
