        Hi, I'm Hugo. Most folks know me as <b>hugocxl</b> online.

      <h2>{"What I'm doing now"}</h2>
      <p>
        ðŸŒŸ Combining my passions into one exciting journey, I run a blog where I
        share captivating posts and handbooks on a wide range of topics that
        spark my interest. Alongside this, my love for software development
        drives me to create open-source software and libraries, contributing to
        the thriving developer community. As a natural educator, I also find joy
        in teaching web development at Ironhack, sharing my knowledge and
        empowering aspiring developers to embark on their own digital
        adventures. ðŸš€
      </p>

      <h2>{'Principles'}</h2>
      <p>
        As an advocate for Software Craftsmanship and the #33943 signer of the
        manifesto, I am dedicated to promoting the art of software development.
        I am passionate about XP, DDD, and TDD, constantly striving for
        excellence in my work. Emphasizing teamwork, collaboration, and
        knowledge sharing, I believe in the power of collective effort. With a
        value-first approach to development, I prioritize delivering meaningful
        solutions. Additionally, I recognize the significance of software design
        essentials, including Design Principles, Design Patterns, Architectural
        Patterns, and Architectural Styles. It's no surprise to find me immersed
        in books on these topics, constantly expanding my knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2>{'Random Facts'}</h2>
      <p>
        I've lived in 5 different cities and I embrace an active lifestyle by
        practicing sports daily. Weight lifting is my favorite, but I also find
        joy in running, cycling, and exploring various other sports. With two
        degrees in construction (Architectural Engineer and Civil Engineer), I
        spent some years working in the field before transitioning into the
        realm of development. When it comes to literature, sci-fi books like
        Dune, The Foundation, and The Three Body Problem series captivate my
        imagination. Additionally, I possess a knack for Photoshop, and while my
        guitar skills are modest from learning at the age of 13, I still enjoy
        playing. In my younger days, one of my beloved hobbies was creating
        electronic music, although I shifted my focus to other interests a few
        years ago.
